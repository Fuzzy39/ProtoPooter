# ProtoPooter/Pooter 3
Pooter 3 is a CPU made in Virtual Circuit Board, a digital logic simulation game.
ProtoPooter is the archecture it uses.
This repository contains all of the files for use in Virtual Circuit Board, as well as some sample programs, primarily meant for testing the processors' functionality.

In its current state, the project has a memory monitor, where the user can type in several commands and use the monitor to run programs as well as write them.
