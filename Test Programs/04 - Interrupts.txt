# 04 - Interrupts
# A test for interrupts.
# The Virtual display should show a small moving pattern.
# pressing a key set up with the virtual keyboard should trigger an interrupt.
# Every time a key is pressed, another block of white will be displayed on the 
# virual display.

# Append this after the language definition file in VCB.
